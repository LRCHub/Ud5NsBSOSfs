DAY ONE OBLIVION
(Music and Lyrics by Juliano Ribeiro)
From now on, the words I speak
Condemn you to eternal decay
Once you're gone, when you sleep
The spiral leaves you closer to the dark
Eternally plagued by every soul you left to die
The fire brings consequences, behold when you rise
Banish thy conscience
For eternity is no more
When one turns to ashes
No one remains as before
Vanish thy words
From a whisper she swore
Thy eternal grace
Dissolved by the dawn
Awake in a void, oblivion
Remember not what you once were
Abandon thy faith
Let the absence take control
Blessed be the fool
Who dies when left all alone
Rise as beasts
Feral eyes obscenity
Conscience no longer exists
Extinguish thy humanity
She's one with the fire, a lasting flame
Burning through her trial, her love remains
She's one with the fire, a final pain
Underneath the surface, we're all the same
When the flames of wrath alight
Believers turn faithless
Desolation heritage
In the name of the divine
Cursed and forsaken
Broken and blind
Damnation ignite
It all ends now
Perpetual closure
Falling to oblivion
It all ends now
Perpetual closure
Falling to oblivion
Once she was one with the light
Sorceress of healing
Sacred, divine
Hope and belief intertwined
Bringer of solace
Pure and sublime
Once she was one with the pain
Embracing their suffering
Horrors mundane
Captured and deemed inhumane
Her eyes of serenity
Once holy, now profane
Once holy, now profane
Now she is one with the fire
Glowing like ember
In the darkness of dire
Consumed by the flames on a pyre
Primal compulsion
Death and desire
Now she is one with the fire
Glowing like ember
In the darkness of dire
Consumed by the flames on a pyre
Dim all her light to ash
Awake in a void, oblivion
Remember not what you once were
Sacrifice myself
For eternity is no more
Standing still, facing the pyre
Nothing remains as before
Perish as beasts
Feral eyes obscenity
Devour the remnants of my being
Extinguish my humanity
She's one with the fire, a lasting flame
Burning through her trial, her love remains
She's one with the fire, a final pain
Underneath the surface, we're all the same
