I can dream the world can chance
I hope the day will come
Everybody's acting strange
And without a heart
People fighting everywhere
There's no love in the air
We all need to stop the hate
And collaborate
What what if all the wars could end one day
What what if only love could find it's way
What what if we could live in harmony
Wha wha one day
What what if all the fights would go away
What what if only peace was here to stay
What what if we could rule with no money
Wha wha one day
What is happening to this world?
People disagree
We should find some common ground
We have to find the key
I never never never stopped
Believing we can
I never ever ever lost
The faith in man
What what if all the wars could end one day
What what if only love could find it's way
What what if we could live in harmony
Wha wha one day
What what if all the fights would go away
What what if only peace was here to stay
What what if we could rule with no money
Wha wha one day
What what if all the wars could end one day
What what if only love could find it's way
What what if we could live in harmony
Wha wha one day
What what if all the fights would go away
What what if only peace was here to stay
What what if we could rule with no money
Wha wha one day
